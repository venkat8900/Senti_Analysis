This Is possibly the most outstanding university Class you will ever take. It Is definitely the best university level course I have ever taken,And I have taken quite a few, both In person And online (MOOC). If you have Any interest whatsoever In how computers learn to recognize faces, text, Or recommend movies you might like, this Class Is nearly perfect In every way.


Having completed a number of MOOCs I was pleasantly surprised to find out how good this one Is. The course Is taught well With lectures that are challenging at first glance but explained well, I felt like I made good progress In understanding the subject.


it Is an awful lecture

The course Is pathetic And content Is very poor. Also the assignments are too bad.
